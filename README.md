This package implements various helper classes and extensions to simplify development with SwiftUI.
My goal is to keep this library up-to-date with reusable components I use while developing apps in SwiftUI and to not reinvent the wheel.

## Installation

Currently only Swift Package Manager is supported. 
Swift Package Manager is a dependency manager built into Xcode.

If you are using Xcode 11 or higher, go to File / Swift Packages / Add Package Dependency... and enter package repository URL https://github.com/dehlen/Shiny.git, then follow the instructions.

To remove the dependency, select the project and open Swift Packages (which is next to Build Settings). You can add and remove packages from this tab.

This library declares 3 targets:
1. Shiny: iOS/macOS components
2. ShinyiOS: iOS only components
3. ShinyMac: macOS only components
